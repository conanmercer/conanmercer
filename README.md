## Hello, world <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="25px">
 
My name is Conan Mercer and I am a Site Reliability Engineering Team Lead currently based in Catalonia. I am interested in system reliability, infrastructure as code, data science, statistics, scientific research, and real world applied projects. I am also fascinated by data visualisation, and public speaking.

I am a fully trained scientist, I take a scientific approach to technical problems.

In my spare time, I run. While running I process life and scientific ideas.
